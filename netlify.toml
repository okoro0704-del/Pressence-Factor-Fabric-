# PFF — Root redirect so Netlify builds the web app from web/
# When this repo is connected to Netlify, use base directory "web" so build runs there.
#
# DEPLOY TO BOTH URLS: One deploy serves BOTH the Netlify app URL (e.g. site-name.netlify.app)
# and your custom domain. Add the custom domain in Netlify: Site → Domain management → Add custom domain.
# No second deploy needed — the same build is served on all domains attached to this site.
#
# Sovereign Shield: Set NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_DOMAIN only on the *custom domain* (e.g. app.purefreedomfoundation.org).
# Do NOT set it on the default *.netlify.app site: that URL stays the Sandbox (Architect Mode, full search, dev panels).
# Supabase: add both your custom domain and https://*.netlify.app to Auth URL / Redirect URLs so Sandbox and live both work.
