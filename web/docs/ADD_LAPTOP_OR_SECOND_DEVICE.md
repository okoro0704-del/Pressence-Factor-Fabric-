# How to add your laptop (or another device) so you can access the app on both phone and laptop

You’re currently in on **mobile** (your phone is the primary/master device). To use the app on your **laptop** as well without removing access from your phone:

## Step 1: On your laptop

1. Open the PFF app in your browser (same URL you use on your phone).
2. Enter your **Sovereign ID** (phone number) when asked.
3. When you see **“New Device Detected”**, choose:
   - **“Add this device — approve from my phone”** (gold button).  
   - Do **not** choose “Authorize only this device (replace phone)” unless you want the laptop to be the only device (your phone would lose access).
4. The laptop will show **“Awaiting Master Authorization”** and wait for approval from your phone.

## Step 2: On your phone (primary device)

1. Open the PFF app and go to the **Dashboard** (vault).
2. A notification should appear: **“[Device name] is requesting access”** (e.g. “Windows Laptop” or “MacBook”).
3. Tap **Approve**.
4. The new device is now added to your account.

## Step 3: Back on your laptop

- The laptop screen should update automatically and then take you to the **Dashboard** (constitution step if needed, then vault).
- From then on, when you open the app on your laptop, you’ll sign in with your Sovereign ID and complete the usual verification; you will **not** see “New Device Detected” again for that laptop.

## Summary

- **Primary device** = the first device you used (your phone). It stays the master.
- **“Add this device — approve from my phone”** = add the laptop as a **second, authorized device**. Both phone and laptop keep access.
- **“Authorize only this device”** = make the laptop the **only** device; your phone loses access.

If the approval prompt doesn’t appear on your phone, make sure you’re on the **Dashboard** (vault) and that the app is in the foreground; the listener runs there. Refresh the dashboard once if needed, then try again from the laptop.
