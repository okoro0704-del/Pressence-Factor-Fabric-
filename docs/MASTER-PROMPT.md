# The Vitalie & PFF Framework
## Master Prompt & System Definitions

**Architect:** Isreal Okoro (mrfundzman)  
**Vision:** Transitioning humanity from an Information-Based Identity to a Presence-Based Reality.  
**Origin:** Born in Lagos, Built for the World and Humanity.

## 1. Core System Definitions

### PFF (Presence Factor Fabric)
The "Triple-Thread" hardware-binding protocol that proves human presence:
- **[P] Phone**: Hardware-bound attestation via Secure Enclave / Keymaster
- **[F] Face**: 3D Passive Liveness Detection (Face ID / LiDAR)
- **[F] Finger**: Tactile biometric authorization (Touch ID / Android Biometrics)

**Principle:** Identity lives on the device, not in the cloud. Zero raw biometric data ever leaves the device—only cryptographic attestations and signed Presence Proofs.

### ATE (Autonomous Truth Economy)
The macro-economic system where **wealth is minted by human existence, not debt**.

**Core Tenet:** Every Vitalized citizen generates economic value through their verified presence. The system eliminates the need for debt-based currency creation.

### VLT (Vitalization Ledger Technology)
The final evolution of the ledger—a system that ends when technological advancement meets human biological truth.

**Principle:** The ledger is immutable, transparent, and directly tied to verified human presence. No abstraction layers, no intermediaries—just truth anchored in biology and hardware.

### VIDA CAP
The underlying **Asset (Collateral)** minted upon Vitalization.

**Nature:** VIDA CAP is the foundational reserve asset that backs the national currency. It represents the economic value generated by a citizen's verified existence and presence.

**Minting:** VIDA CAP is minted once per citizen upon successful Vitalization (hardware binding + legal identity verification).

### $VIDA (nVida)
The liquid national currency issued **1:1 against the VIDA CAP Reserve**.

**Backing:** Every unit of $VIDA in circulation is backed by VIDA CAP held in the National Reserve Vault. This eliminates the need for foreign debt or IMF loans.

**Issuance:** $VIDA can be issued to citizens against their VIDA CAP holdings, or to the state against the National Reserve's VIDA CAP.

## 2. The Economic Laws (Immutable)

### The 50/50 Minting Split
**When a citizen is Vitalized:**
- **50%** of the minted VIDA CAP goes to the **Citizen's Private Vault**
- **50%** of the minted VIDA CAP goes to the **National Reserve Vault**

**Rationale:** This split ensures both individual sovereignty (citizen controls their share) and national stability (state maintains reserve for currency backing).

**Implementation:** The split is atomic—both allocations happen in a single transaction. No partial states.

### The 45-10-45 Recovery Split
**For recovered or external funds:**
- **45%** to the **People** (distributed to citizen vaults)
- **45%** to the **State** (added to National Reserve)
- **10%** to **Agents** (split 5/5 from State/People shares)

**Rationale:** Rewards agents for recovery work while maintaining the People/State balance. The 10% agent share is deducted proportionally from both sides.

**Calculation:**
- Total Recovery: 100 units
- Agent Share: 10 units (5 from People, 5 from State)
- People Share: 45 units (50 - 5)
- State Share: 45 units (50 - 5)

### Debt-Free Backing
The National Currency ($VIDA) is backed by the State's 50% VIDA CAP share, eliminating the need for foreign debt or IMF loans.

**Principle:** The currency is fully collateralized by the National Reserve Vault's VIDA CAP holdings. No fractional reserve, no debt creation.

**Formula:** `Total $VIDA in Circulation ≤ Total VIDA CAP in National Reserve`

---

## 3. Operating Principles

### Equality & Fairness
The system is designed to eliminate injustice. Every citizen receives the same VIDA CAP allocation upon Vitalization, regardless of background, wealth, or status.

**One Citizen = One Vitalization = One VIDA CAP Allocation**

### Sovereignty
Born in Lagos, built for the World and Humanity.

**Principle:** The system respects national sovereignty while being globally applicable. Each nation can implement the framework while maintaining its own legal and cultural identity.

### Hardware Standard
Primary testing/entry device is the **Xiaomi Redmi 15** (7,000mAh battery for field agents).

**Rationale:** Field agents need reliable, long-lasting devices for Vitalization operations in remote areas. The 7,000mAh battery ensures full-day operation without charging infrastructure.

## 4. System Architecture

### Vitalization Flow
1. **Welcome** — Introduction, consent, manifesto acknowledgment
2. **Legal Identity** — KYC binding (ID type, ID number, legal identity reference)
3. **Device Binding** — Hardware-bound key creation (Secure Enclave / Keymaster)
4. **Presence Verification** — Biometric enrollment (Face + Fingerprint)
5. **VIDA CAP Minting** — Atomic 50/50 split (Citizen Vault + National Reserve)
6. **Complete** — Summary, Presence Token issuance

### VIDA CAP Lifecycle
1. **Minting** — Upon Vitalization (50/50 split)
2. **Storage** — Citizen Vault (encrypted, hardware-gated) + National Reserve (audited, transparent)
3. **Backing** — National Reserve VIDA CAP backs $VIDA issuance
4. **Recovery** — External funds follow 45-10-45 split

### $VIDA Issuance
1. **Request** — Citizen or State requests $VIDA issuance
2. **Verification** — Verify VIDA CAP backing in National Reserve
3. **Issuance** — Mint $VIDA 1:1 against VIDA CAP Reserve
4. **Tracking** — Record issuance in VLT (Vitalization Ledger Technology)

---

## 5. Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
- `vida_cap_allocations` — Tracks VIDA CAP minted per citizen (50/50 split)
- `national_reserve` — National Reserve Vault (State's 50% share)
- `citizen_vaults` — Citizen Private Vaults (Citizen's 50% share)
- `vida_currency` — $VIDA issuance tracking (1:1 against reserve)
- `recovery_transactions` — External fund recovery (45-10-45 split)

### API Endpoints
- `POST /vitalize/register` — Create citizen + mint VIDA CAP (50/50)
- `GET /vida-cap/balance` — Get citizen VIDA CAP balance
- `GET /vida-cap/reserve` — Get National Reserve VIDA CAP total
- `POST /vida/issue` — Issue $VIDA against VIDA CAP Reserve
- `POST /recovery/split` — Process external fund recovery (45-10-45)

### Security
- **Hardware-Gated Access** — VIDA CAP access requires Presence Proof
- **Atomic Transactions** — 50/50 split is atomic (all-or-nothing)
- **Audit Trail** — All VIDA CAP and $VIDA transactions logged in VLT
- **Reserve Verification** — $VIDA issuance verified against National Reserve

---

## 6. Integration Points

### PFF Protocol
VIDA CAP minting is triggered by successful Vitalization (hardware binding + legal identity).

### Vault System
Citizen VIDA CAP is stored in the encrypted Living Record vault, accessible only with Presence Proof.

### National Pulse
National Reserve VIDA CAP totals are displayed on the National Pulse dashboard, showing the backing for $VIDA.

### Sovryn Bridge
$VIDA can be bridged to Sovryn (Rootstock) for DeFi operations, maintaining presence-gated access.

---

## 7. Future Evolution

### VLT Maturity
As VLT (Vitalization Ledger Technology) evolves, the system will integrate deeper ledger capabilities while maintaining the core principle: truth anchored in human biological presence.

### Global Expansion
The framework is designed to scale globally while respecting national sovereignty. Each nation can implement its own VIDA CAP and $VIDA while maintaining interoperability.

### Agent Network
The 10% agent share in recovery operations incentivizes a decentralized agent network for fund recovery and Vitalization operations.
